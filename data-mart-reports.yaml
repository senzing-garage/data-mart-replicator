        The optional parameter to provide for "paging" through entity ID's
        associated with a statistic.  The value is specified as a bound on the
        entity ID values returned and is given as a positive integer number
        or `max` to indicate the maximum legal value of an entity ID.  The
        type of bound is given by the `boundType` parameter.  For example, by
        default the `boundType` is `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` so the returned entity ID
        values must satisfy the condition that they are strictly greater than
        the entity ID bound value.  To move to the "next page" of entity ID's
        specify the greatest entity ID value from the current page and use
        `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER`.  To move to the "previous page" of
        entity ID's specify the least entity ID value on the current page and
        use `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER`.  To change the number of results
        shown on the current page specify the least entity ID value on the
        current page and specify a `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` with a new
        `pageSize` value.

        If not specified, then the default value is taken as `0` if a
        `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` is being used,
        otherwise for a `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_UPPER` or `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER`
        it defaults to `max` (indicating the maximum legal value of an 
        entity ID).

    relationBoundQueryParam:

      description: >-
        The optional parameter to provide for "paging" through relationships
        associated with a statistic.  The value is specified as a bound on the
        entity ID's in the `SzRelation` values returned and contains two 
        entity ID values separated by a colon (e.g.: `1000:5500`).  Either of
        the entity ID's can be specified as `max` to indicate the maximum legal
        value of an entity ID (e.g.: `max:max` or `1000:max`).  If `max` is
        specified by itself it is interpreted as `max:max`. The type of bound
        is given by the `boundType` parameter.  For example, by default the
        `boundType` is `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` so the returned `SzRelation` values
        must be canonically greater than the relationship described by the 
        entity ID values encoded in the bound.  `SzRelation` values are ordered 
        on the first entity ID value and then on the second related entity ID
        value.  To move to the "next page" of relationships specify the encoded
        value of the entity ID and related ID of the greatest (last) `SzRelation`
        on the current page and use `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER`.  To move to
        the "previous page" of relationships specify the encoded value of the
        entity ID and related ID of the least (first) `SzRelation` on the current
        page and use `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER`.  To change the number of
        results shown on the current page specify the encoded value of the entity
        ID and related ID of the least (first) `SzRelation` on the current page
        and specify a `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` with a new `pageSize` value.

        If not specified, then the default value is taken as `0:0` if a `boundType`
        of `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` is being used, otherwise for a
        `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_UPPER` or `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER` it defaults to

        with a statistic.  The value is specified as an `SzBoundType` and the 
        bound value is given by the `bound` parameter.  For example, by default
        the `boundType` is `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` so the returned values must satisfy
        the condition that they are strictly greater than the bound value.  To move
        to the "next page" of results specify the greatest result value from the
        current page and use `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER`.  To move to the 
        "previous page" of results specify the least result value on the current
        page and use a `boundType` of `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER`.  To change the number of
        results shown on the current page specify the least result value on the
        current page and specify a `boundType` of `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` with a new
        `pageSize` value.  Possible values are:
          * `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` - The bound represents an inclusive lower bound whereby
                                values satisfying the bound will be greater-than or equal
                                to the value associated with the bound.

                                values satisfying the bound will be strictly greater-than 
                                the value associated with the bound.

                                to the value associated with the bound.

        then this simply defaults to `100`.  If using the `sampleSize` query 
        parameter and specifying a value for the `pageSize` then the `pageSize` 
        should be greater than the `sampleSize` by at least an order of magnitude
        in order tp provide an adequate set of results from which to choose a random
        sample.  For example, a `pageSize` of `1000` would be appropriate for a

        typically use a much larger page size (e.g.: 1000 or 5000) and pull a 
        random sample (e.g.: 50 to 100).  To obtain another sample with no overlap
        with the previous sample(s), simply change the `bound` and `boundType`
        parameter so the eligible results for the page are outside the range
        of the previous sample(s).  The value of this parameter should be less-than
